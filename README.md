As modern consumers, we greatly benefit from product recommendation applications. In particular, it is convenient to get a list of restaurants that match our preferences without much clicking, comparing, and browsing through long lists of reviews for each and every single business. 
Thus, our project focuses on creating a repository of restaurant ratings from users, for other users to search and browse by restaurant category and name, Also, Provide an experience to Order food from a restaurant in their vicinity.
